# Data Scientist With Python Track

### Intro to Python for Data Science

This course focuses on Python specifically for data science. In our Intro to Python class, you will learn about powerful ways to store and manipulate data as well as cool data science tools to start your own analyses.

### Intermediate Python for Data Science

Learn to visualize real data with matplotlib's functions,  get to know new data structures such as the dictionary and the Pandas DataFrame and key concepts such as boolean logic, control flow and loops in Python,

### Python Data Science Toolbox (Part 1)

Learn to write own custom functions, complete with multiple parameters and multiple return values, along with default arguments and variable-length arguments.  Gain insight into scoping in Python and be able to write lambda functions and handle errors in function writing practice. On top of this, wrap up each Chapter by diving into using newly acquired skills to write functions that analyze twitter DataFrames and are generalizable to broader Data Science contexts

### Python Data Science Toolbox (Part 2)

Learn iterators, list comprehensions. End the course by working through a case study to apply all of the Data Science Toolbox techniques learned both in this course as well as the prequel.

### Importing Data in Python (Part 1)

Learn the many ways to import data into Python:
(i) from flat files such as .txts and .csvs;
(ii) from files native to other software such as Excel spreadsheets, Stata, SAS and MATLAB files;
(iii) from relational databases such as SQLite & PostgreSQL.

### Importing Data in Python (Part 2)

Learn to import data
(i) from the web;
(ii) pulling data from Application Programming Interfaces, also known as APIs, such as the Twitter streaming API, which allows us to stream real-time tweets.

### Cleaning Data in Python

Learn to clean data in Python, from learning how to diagnose data for problems to dealing with missing values and outliers. At the end of the course, apply all of the techniques learned to a case study of cleaning a real-world Gapminder dataset!

### pandas Foundations

Learn how to use the industry-standard pandas library to import, build, and manipulate DataFrames, convert data into a form that permits me to analyze it easily. Also learn more about NumPy, how it stores data, and its relation to the pandas DataFrame.

### Manipulating DataFrames with pandas

Learn how to leverage pandas' extremely powerful data manipulation engine to get the most out of data. It is important to be able to extract, filter, and transform data from DataFrames in order to drill into the data that really matters. Learn how to tidy, rearrange, and restructure data by pivoting or melting and stacking or unstacking DataFrames. In the end have the chance to apply all the concepts learned to real-world datasets.

### Merging DataFrames with pandas

 This course is all about the act of combining, or merging, DataFrames, an essential part of any working Data Scientist's toolbox. Hone pandas skills by learning how to organize, reshape, and aggregate multiple data sets to answer specific questions.

### Introduction to Databases in Python

Learn the basics of using Structured Query Language (SQL) with Python. The Python SQL toolkit SQLAlchemy provides an accessible and intuitive way to query, build & write to SQLite, MySQL and Postgresql databases.


### Introduction to Data Visualization with Python

This course extends Intermediate Python for Data Science to provide a stronger foundation in data visualization in Python. The course provides a broader coverage of the Matplotlib library and an overview of Seaborn (a package for statistical graphics). Topics covered include customizing graphics, plotting two-dimensional arrays (e.g., pseudocolor plots, contour plots, images, etc.), statistical graphics (e.g., visualizing distributions & regressions), and working with time series and image data.

### Interactive Data Visualization with Boken

Bokeh is an interactive data visualization library for Python (and other languages!) that targets modern web browsers for presentation. It can create versatile, data-driven graphics, and connect the full power of the entire Python data-science stack to rich, interactive visualizations.

### Statistical Thinking in Python (Part 1)

In this course, start building the foundation one need to think statistically, to speak the language of data, to understand what they are telling with the power of Python-based tools.

### Statistical Thinking in Python (Part 2)

Expand and hone hacker stats toolbox to perform the two key tasks in statistical inference, parameter estimation and hypothesis testing. Work with real data sets culminating with analysis of measurements of the beaks of the Darwin's famous finches.

### Supervised Learning with scikit-learn

 Learn how to use Python to perform supervised learning, an essential component of Machine Learning. Learn how to build predictive models, how to tune their parameters and how to tell how well they will perform on unseen data, all the while using real world datasets. Use scikit-learn, one of the most popular and user-friendly machine learning libraries for Python.

### Machine Learning with the Experts: School Budgets

This course is a case study from a machine learning competition on DrivenData. Explore a problem related to school district budgeting. By building a model to automatically classify items in a school's budget, it makes it easier and faster for schools to compare their spending with other schools. In this course, begin by building a baseline model that is a simple, first-pass approach. In particular, do some natural language processing to prepare the budgets for modeling. Next, have the opportunity to try own techniques and see how they compare to participants from the competition. Finally, see how the winner was able to combine a number of expert techniques to build the most accurate model.

### Unsupervised Learning in Python

Learn the fundamentals of unsupervised learning and implement the essential algorithms using scikit-learn and scipy. Learn how to cluster, transform, visualize, and extract insights from unlabeled datasets, and end the course by building a recommender system to recommend popular musical artists.

### Deep Learning in Python

Deep learning is the machine learning technique behind the most exciting capabilities in diverse areas like robotics, natural language processing, image recognition and artificial intelligence (including the famous AlphaGo). In this course, gain hands-on, practical knowledge of how to use deep learning with Keras 2.0, the latest version of a cutting edge library for deep learning in Python.

### Net Work Analysis in Python

This course will equip you with the skills to analyze, visualize, and make sense of networks. You'll apply the concepts you learn to real-world network data using the powerful NetworkX library.
